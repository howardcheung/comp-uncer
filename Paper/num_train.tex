\subsection{Effect of number of training data points on map output} \label{subsec:num_train}

To understand how the number of training data points affect the map output, another map (Map 7) was created with the same range of training data as Map 1 and 24 data points only, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:map_1_7_training_data}. The accuracy of Map 7, rated by coefficient of variation $cov$ as 

\begin{equation}
cov = \frac{\text{Mean of the sum of squares of errors}}{\text{Mean value of estimated values}} = \frac{\sigma}{1/n\cdot\Sigma_1^n \hat{y}_i}
\label{eq:cov}
\end{equation}
is compared with that of Map 1 in Table \ref{tb:map7_acc}.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{\label{tb:map7_acc}Accuracy of Maps 1 and 7.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{1.2cm} p{6cm} p{5.7cm}}

Map & Coefficient of variation based on training data poinst only ($cov_{train}$) & Coefficient of variation based on all data points in Figure \ref{fig:oper_envelope} ($cov_{all}$) \\
\mr
Map 1&0.18\%&0.31\%\\
Map 7&0.17\%&1.10\%\\
\br
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tb:map7_acc} shows that the accuracy of Map 7 is similar to that of Map 1 at the training data points, but the analysis with all available data points shows that Map 7 is less accurate than Map 1. This shows that using fewer training data points reduces map accuracy. To understand if it is related to extrapolation, the difference between the power consumption estimation and their approximated measurement with the distance, e.g. $\sqrt{\Delta T_{cond}^2 + \Delta T_{evap}^2}$, from the nearest training data point as shown in Figures \ref{fig:map_1_7_unc_C_distance} and \ref{fig:map_1_7_training_data}.

\end{minipage} 
\end{figure}

As shown in Figures \ref{fig:map_1_7_unc_C_distance} and \ref{fig:map_1_7_training_data}, although the range of training data points in both maps is the same, the effect of the reduced number of points in the training data is pronounced for large distances (e.g. extrapolated outside training data range of map) of 10\dgC{} or larger and can increase the uncertainty from 10\% (Map 1) to around 17\% (Map 7) in the most extreme case.

This shows that the inaccuracy due to the reduction of training data can be shown by uncertainty. To understand why uncertianty can show this, Figures \ref{fig:num_train_model} and \ref{fig:num_train_train} are plotted.

\caption{\label{fig:num_train_train}Change of accuracy of maps with uncertainty from training data in Maps 1 and 7.}
\end{minipage} 
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:num_train_model} and \ref{fig:num_train_train} show that both the accuracy of Maps 1 and 7 decreases as their uncertainty from model random error and the uncertainty from training data increase, and the reduction of Map 1 accuracy in both figures are more rapid than Map 7. This shows that Map 7, despite having the same training data range as Map 1, is less applicable and accurate as Map 1. This shows that extrapolation uncertainty and accuracy are not only affected by the range of training data but also the number of training data points.\\
