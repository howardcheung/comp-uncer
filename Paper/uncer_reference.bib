  title = {Compressor Selection and Equipment Sizing for Cold Climate Heat Pumps},
  booktitle = {2014 IEA HP conference},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {An extensive array of air source heat pump design and sizing options
	were
	
	investigated to identify solutions to limit heating capacity degradation
	at -13°F (-25°C)
	
	ambient to 25%, compared to the nominal rating point capacity at
	47°F (8.3°C). Sixteen
	
	equipment design options were evaluated in one commercial building
	and one residential
	
	building, respectively in seven cities. The energy simulation results
	were compared to three
	
	baseline cases: 100% electric resistance heating, a 9.6 Btu/Wh (2.8
	W/W) heating seasonal
	
	performance factor (HSPF) single-speed air-source heat pump unit,
	and 90% AFUE gas
	
	heating system. The general recommendation is that variable-speed
	compressors and
	
	tandem compressors, sized such that their rated heating capacity at
	a low speed matches
	
	the building design cooling load, are able to achieve the capacity
	goal at low ambient
	
	temperatures by over-speeding. For example, in a home with a 3.0 ton
	(10.6 kW) design
	
	cooling load, a tandem heat pump could meet this cooling load running
	a single compressor,
	
	while running both compressors to meet heating load at low ambient
	temperatures in a cold
	
	climate. Energy savings and electric resistance heat reductions vary
	with building types,
	
	energy codes and climate zones. Oversizing a heat pump can result
	in larger energy saving
	
	in a less energy efficient building and colder regions due to reducing
	electric resistance
	
	heating. However, in a more energy-efficient building or for buildings
	in warmer climates, one
	
	has to consider balance between reduction of resistance heat and addition
	of cyclic loss.},

  title = {Simulation of an Air-Source Heat Pump with Two-Stage Compression
	and Economizing for Cold Climates},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {A new air-source heat pump technology optimized for cold climates
	was designed and fabricated by the authors in
	
	close cooperation with three industrial partners. The constructed
	unit will undergo a field demonstration in a military
	
	barrack to identify heat pumps as cost effective systems that have
	less primary energy consumption when compared
	
	to traditional cold climate heating methods. A simulation model developed
	in EES predicted the designed heat pump
	
	performance at different ambient conditions. The EES results were
	incorporated with a TRNSYS model to couple
	
	the military barrack building load with the available heat pump capacity
	using weather data. The TRNSYS model
	
	enables the assessment of the field demonstration performance during
	the heating season.
	
	The heat pump design is based on two-stage compression with economizing.
	Commercially available components
	
	were selected for all parts of the heat pump. A variable-speed scroll
	compressor is used as the high-stage compressor
	
	matched with a tandem fixed-speed scroll compressor used as the low-stage
	compressor. The configuration has a
	
	predicted capacity of 18.34 kW (62,580 BTU/h) at the design ambient
	temperature of -20oC (4oF) based on the EES
	
	simulation results. The building has a heating load of less than 18
	kW for more than 95% of the heating season that
	
	lasts 8 months out of the year. The heat pump design therefore is
	predicted to satisfy the building heating load for
	
	the entire heating season. The heating season COP based on TRNSYS
	hourly simulation results is 3.67 with a
	
	yearly heating capacity of 30,970 kWh (105,674 kBTU) and 8,438.37
	kWh (28,793 kBTU). The CCHP simulations
	
	predict over 30% savings in primary energy and CO2 emissions with
	a 25% cost savings for annual heating energy
	
	use compared to an 85% AFUE natural gas furnace.},
