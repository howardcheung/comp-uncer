\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future_work}
1) use experimental data -> find distribution since normal distribution assumption (for data generation) might not be valid

2) Manufacuring variability wrt to different compressors of same model
a) manufacturing variability -> some inital test with multiple compressors from same manufacturing line for a few conditions
b) if a) large variation do design of experiments to future investigate
