\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Empirical compressor maps for positive displacement compressors, such as the 10-coefficient polynomials outlined in ANSI/AHRI Standard 540 \cite{AHRI:540} and European Standard EN 12900 \cite{CEN:2013}  are widely used in academia and industry.  These maps are trained with experimental data and then used to calculate power input, mass flow rate, current, and compressor efficiency.  However, the maps contain squared and cubic terms of the inputs (suction and discharge dew point temperature) and are therefore potentially inaccurate when used at points other than the training data \blCom{The inaccuracy does not come from the equation form, but rather, from the limitation of the training data to describe the entire operating range because we do not have infinite data points.}. Manufacturers often state an accuracy of $\pm 5 \%$ for tabulated performance data (e.g. \cite{emerson:2006} or \cite{bristol:2015}).
This paper shows a method that estimates the resulting uncertainty for the 10 coefficient polynomial at a certain point other than the training data set. \\
This paper does not address interpolation between different speeds of variable speed compressors. However, the shown methodology can be extended to predict the uncertainty of the outputs for interpolating between fixed speeds rather than using different fixed speed compressor maps as done by e.g.  \cite{shen:2014} and \cite{caskey:2012}.
