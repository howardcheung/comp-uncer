\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:concl}

To conclude, this paper demonstrates how uncertainty of 10-coefficient compressor maps can be calculated based on the uncertainty due to inputs, the uncertainty due to model random error, the uncertainty due to training data and the uncertainty from outputs. It shows a method to assess the acuracy and applicability of the map output under extrapolation without measuring the output variable. It also shows that the range of training data and the number of training data points affect the accuracy and applicability of the map.
